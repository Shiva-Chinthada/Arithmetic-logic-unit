An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental building block of digital systems, performing arithmetic and logical operations required by processors. In this project, an ALU is designed and implemented using Verilog, showcasing its ability to execute operations like addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and comparison functions. The design involves defining control signals to select the desired operation, creating modular and efficient hardware structures, and validating correctness through simulation. This project highlights the practical realization of a core processor component in hardware description language, bridging theoretical concepts with real-world digital design.
